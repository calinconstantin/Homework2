#We have a maze, a mouse and a cheese. 
#The mouse and cheese are randomly placed in the maze. 
#Create an algorithm that finds the shortest path between the mouse and the cheese.
#Beside mouse and cheese there are placed radnomly walls that cannot be passed.

# For calulating the shortest distance I used:
# Dijkstra's algorithm
